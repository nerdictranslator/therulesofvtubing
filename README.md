# The Rules of VTubing - Revision 1.0

1. Being unhinged is good for business.
2. Being unkind is good for business until it's not.
	 * If you don't come from old money, you can't get away with it forever.
3. Never worry about being cringe; that ship sailed when you became a VTuber.
4. Never sacrifice your dignity for money, but never let your dignity get in the way of a good bit.
5. There are enough ~~simps~~ fans for everyone.
	* Attempting to poach them can cost you opportunities in the future.
6. When someone tells you they can make you a lot of money, make sure they have a lot of money before you sign anything.
7. People with a lot of money want more money, and often can't be trusted either.
8. Trust, but verify.
9. Any VTuber without a data backup system will graduate sooner than expected.
10. Any VTuber without a redundant backup system will graduate sooner than expected.
11. Never piss off your artist or rigger unless you can draw or rig.
12. If you can draw and rig, you should know better than to piss them off in any case.
13. Honor your contracts. It inspires your business partners to do the same.
	* Caveat: Your mileage may vary depending on the business partner.
14. Before every interaction with another person, ask yourself: WTLGIAGD? That is, Would this look good in a Google Doc? If the answer is "no," don't do it.
15. Being good at games is great for business. Being bad at games in an entertaining way is also good for business, and much easier.
16. Making reaction content is the Devil's work.
17. The Devil pays well, and has a better reputation than some VTuber agencies.
18. Respect the LewdTubers. They deal with a lot of crap, and you'll want them on your side if you ever go that route.
19. Chat is not your friend.
20. Chat is not your enemy.
21. Be grateful for every single follower you have, but be ready to tell any single one of them to fuck off.
22. Respect the Furries. They intentionally expose themselves to more crap than you can imagine, and they just keep going. Besides, you'll need an infosec person one day.
23. If you don't have merch, make merch. If you do have merch, make more merch.
24. Always post your going live links. People may not click them, but it reminds them you're alive.
25. The size of a VTuber's audience doesn't matter until it does.
26. Don't encourage parasocial behavior unless you're prepared for weird and unsettling behavior to follow.
27. Hard work is a necessary part of being a VTuber.
28. People will ignore the things you work hardest on, and your shitposts will blow up. Rule 27 still applies somehow.
29. First and foremost, collab with people whose company you enjoy.
30. Make sure they know you enjoy their company. No, seriously, tell them.
31. You don't have to stream to be a VTuber.
32. You don't need to have any particular kind of model to be a VTuber.
33. You don't need to make a specific kind of content to be a VTuber, though people will expect at least some of your work to come in video form.
34. Protect the baby VTubers as best you can. You were young and dumb once upon a time.
35. You can't insult older VTubers. Let me be clear: you can try, but you'll never think of anything we haven't said to ourselves in the mirror at some point.
36. Jump on every opportunity you can, when you can. A certain amount of failure is good for you, and more to the point, it can be really funny to watch.
37. When you're more established, encourage baby VTubers to jump on every opportunity they can, when they can. A certain amount of failure is good for them, and more to the point, it can be really funny to watch.
38. Don't lie to yourself. Plenty of people will try to do that for you.
39. Don't expect to make a lot of money from VTubing. Rich VTubers are the exception, not the rule.
40. Your model is going to cost you a lot of money, or a lot of time, and sometimes both. Get used to it.
41. Optimizing and expanding your VTubing/recording/streaming setup can actually be more fun than streaming and recording. This is a trap.
42. Never be afraid to take breaks. Nah, there's no joke here, just do it.
43. Some people will always demand more from you, no matter the cost to you. See rule 21 for instructions on how to deal with them.
44. Never show the feet.
45. Or do. Just understand that, even with digital feet, you can't go back.
46. Everyone is going to tell you to make a lore video, but that doesn't mean they'll watch it. Make it anyway, just for fun.
47. For anime's sake, have fun with it. Otherwise, what's the point? 
48. It's true. Some of us really are 30+ year old men behind these hot models.
49. Never listen to random 30+ year old men who become VTubers and go around making up "Rules of VTubing."
50. You are more than your content, your model, the size of your audience, or the money you make.
