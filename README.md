# The Rules of VTubing - Revision 0.1

1. Being unhinged is good for business.
2. Being unkind is good for business until it's not.
	 * If you don't come from old money, you can't get away with it forever.
3. Never worry about being cringe; that ship sailed when you became a VTuber.
4. Never sacrifice your dignity for money, but never let your dignity get in the way of a good bit.
5. There are enough ~~simps~~ fans for everyone.
	* Attempting to poach them can cost you opportunities in the future.
6. When someone tells you they can make you a lot of money, make sure they have a lot of money before you sign anything.
7. People with a lot of money want more money, and often can't be trusted either.
8. Trust, but verify.
9. Any VTuber without a data backup system will graduate sooner than expected.
10. Any VTuber without a redundant backup system will graduate sooner than expected.
11. Never piss off your artist or rigger unless you can draw or rig.
12. If you can draw and rig, you should know better than to piss them off in any case.
13. Honor your contracts. It inspires your business partners to do the same.
	* Caveat: Your mileage may vary depending on the business partner.
14. Before every interaction with another person, ask yourself: WTLGIAGD? That is, Would this look good in a Google Doc? If the answer is "no," don't do it.
15. Being good at games is great for business. Being bad at games in an entertaining way is also good for business, and much easier.
16. Making reaction content is the Devil's work.
17. The Devil pays well, and has a better reputation than some VTuber agencies.
18. Respect the LewdTubers. They deal with a lot of crap, and you'll want them on your side if you ever go that route.
19. Chat is not your friend.
20. Chat is not your enemy.
21. Be grateful for every single follower you have, but be ready to tell any single one of them to fuck off.

These are the rules of VTubing. They are permanent and unchanging unless I update the official file in the GitHub repository, or someone submits a really good pull request. 

That's right, you can contribute your own rules. If I like them, I'll add them to the list. You can also make your own list based on mine. Just note that if you use any of what I've written here, attribution is required by the license listed below (i.e. you have to give me credit for the original work). Also, your own list must be distributed under the same license.
